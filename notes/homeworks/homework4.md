## Description

Continue your effort from lab 6 to make order now stored under database
as well. To do so, you will need to first create schema.sql containing
database table creation & dummy data insertion.

Then, you will need to implement the DAO interface with OrderDAO.java to
implement CRUD functions.

Finally, replace the Java Servlets where you read/update order to use
OrderDAO.java while keeping the site still functional.

## Requirements

* Functional requirements stays the same
* Order should be stored in database
* Password should not be stored under Github
