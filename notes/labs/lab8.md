## Description

Lab 8 is cover up lab, you can use this lab to redo one of the earlier lab
(probably the worst lab you have before), and I will regrade such lab. You will
be getting free 5 points on doing so for lab 8 and the earlier lab that you re-do
will also be regraded toward that specific lab.
